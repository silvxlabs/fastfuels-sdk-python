# Welcome to the FastFuels Python SDK Documentation!


## What is FastFuels?


FastFuels is a cloud-based platform for generating forest inventory data. It

uses a combination of satellite imagery and machine learning to generate

tabular tree data and voxelized 3D fuel models. These data products can be used

to support wildfire risk assessment, fire behavior modeling, and other

applications.


## What is the FastFuels Python SDK?

interface for interacting with the FastFuels API. It can be used to create and

manage FastFuels resources. It can also be used to download and process

generated data products.
