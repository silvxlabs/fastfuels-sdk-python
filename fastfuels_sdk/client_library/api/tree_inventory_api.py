        # Create Tree Inventory  This endpoint creates a new tree inventory resource for a specific domain. Tree Inventory data represents a complete forest inventory that exists within the spatial context of a domain. The tree inventory data can be generated using various data products and models that provide either national coverage (e.g., TreeMap) or local coverage.  On resource creation, the tree inventory data is set to a status of \"pending\". The tree inventory data is generated in the background using the specified method (e.g., TreeMap). Once the tree inventory data is generated and available for user access, the status is updated to \"completed\".  ## Endpoint  ``` POST /v1/domains/{domainId}/inventories/tree ```  ## Path Parameters  - `domainId` (string, required): The unique identifier of the domain for   which you want to create the tree inventory.  ## Request Body  The request body should be a JSON object containing the following fields:  - `sources` (array of strings, required): List of data sources to be used for building the tree inventory. Currently, only one data source at a time is supported. Possible values are:   - `\"TreeMap\"`: Indicates that the tree inventory should be created using the TreeMap raster product. This approach generates a tree inventory with national coverage.   - `\"file\"`: Indicates that you will upload a file via a signed url. Please see File Source Configuration for more info.  - `modifications` (array of objects, optional): List of modifications to apply to the tree inventory data. Maximum 1000 modifications allowed.  - `treatments` (array of objects, optional): List of silvicultural treatments to apply to the tree inventory. Maximum 1000 treatments allowed.  - `featureMasks` (array of strings, optional): List of Features to mask tree inventory data.  ### TreeMap Source Configuration  If `\"TreeMap\"` is included in the `sources`, the request body can include additional configurations for `TreeMap`:  - `TreeMap` (object, optional): Advanced configurations for the TreeMap data source.   - `version` (string, optional): The version of TreeMap to use. Default is `\"2016\"`. Possible values are:     - `\"2014\"`: Use the 2014 version of TreeMap.     - `\"2016\"`: Use the 2016 version of TreeMap.   - `seed` (integer, optional): The random seed to use for generating the tree inventory. If not provided, a random seed will be generated.   - `canopyHeightMapConfiguration` (object, optional): Canopy height map configuration for TreeMap data source. If provided, the canopy height map will be used to segment and impute the coarse 30m TreeMap data with high-resolution canopy height data. Details of this approach will be provided in an upcoming publication. Please contact support.fastfuels@silvxlabs.com for more information.     - `source` (string, required): The source of the canopy height map data. Possible values are:         - `\"Meta2024\"`: Use the Meta2024 canopy height map data. More information about this data source can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442572300439X  ### File Source Configuration Generate Signed URL for Tree Inventory Upload  If the source is `\"file\"`, this endpoint generates a signed URL that allows users to upload a CSV file representing the tree inventory data. The signed URL is valid for 1 hour and has a maximum upload size of 500 MB.  The full work flow consists of the following steps: 1. Call this endpoint to get a signed URL 2. Perform a put request to send your file to the signed url. Here is a python example:  ```[python] with open(\"your_file_goes_here.csv\", \"rb\") as file:     upload_response = requests.put(         signed_url_response[\"file\"][\"url\"],         data=file,         headers=signed_url_response[\"file\"][\"headers\"],     ) ``` **Note**: the signed_url_response has a field named \"file\" with the relevant info for the put request.  3. Your file will be validated and processed in the background 4. The status of your upload can be retrieved via and inventory get() request  #### Required Columns  The CSV file must include the following columns with their specified data types and constraints:  1. **TREE_ID** (Integer)    - Unique identifier for each tree    - Must be an integer    - Cannot contain duplicates  2. **SPCD** (Integer)    - FIA species code    - Must be an integer    - Represents standard FIA species classifications  3. **STATUSCD** (Integer)    - Tree status code    - Must be one of these values:      - 0: No status      - 1: Live      - 2: Dead      - 3: Missing  4. **DIA** (Float)    - Diameter at breast height (DBH)    - Unit: centimeters (cm)    - Range: 0 to 1200 cm    - Nullable: Yes    - Measured at 1.37 meters above ground  5. **HT** (Float)    - Tree height    - Unit: meters (m)    - Range: 0 to 116 meters    - Nullable: Yes    - Measured from ground to tree top  6. **CR** (Float)    - Crown ratio    - Unit: ratio (dimensionless)    - Range: 0 to 1    - Nullable: Yes    - Represents the ratio of crown length to total tree height  7. **X** (Float)    - X coordinate in projected coordinate system    - Unit: meters (m)    - Range: Must fall within domain bounds (west to east)    - Required: Yes    - Nullable: Yes    - Used for spatial positioning  8. **Y** (Float)    - Y coordinate in projected coordinate system    - Unit: meters (m)    - Range: Must fall within domain bounds (south to north)    - Required: Yes    - Nullable: Yes    - Used for spatial positioning  ### Treatments  The `treatments` field is an array of treatment objects. Each treatment object represents a silvicultural treatment to be applied to the tree inventory. Currently, there are two types of treatment types available:  1. Proportional Thinning 2. Directional Thinning  #### Proportional Thinning  - `method`: \"proportionalThinning\" (string, required) - `targetMetric`: \"basalArea\" (string, required) - `targetValue`: float (required)   - Unit: square meters per hectare (m²/ha)   - Represents the target basal area after thinning  #### Directional Thinning  - `method`: \"directionalThinning\" (string, required) - `direction`: (string, required)   - Possible values: \"below\" or \"above\"   - Indicates whether to thin from below (smallest to largest) or above (largest to smallest) - `targetMetric`: (string, required)   - Possible values: \"diameter\" or \"basalArea\" - `targetValue`: float (required)   - Units of the targetValue quantity depends on the targetMetric:     - For \"diameter\": centimeters (cm)     - For \"basalArea\": square meters per hectare (m²/ha)   - Represents the threshold for thinning (diameter) or the target basal area after thinning  Note: The order of treatments in the array determines the sequence in which they will be applied to the tree inventory.  ## Response  If the request is successful, the endpoint will return a `201 Created` status code and the created tree inventory resource in the response body. The response body will be a JSON object with the following fields:  - `status` (string): The status of the tree inventory. Will be set to `\"pending\"` initially. - `createdOn` (string): The timestamp when the tree inventory was created. - `modifiedOn` (string): The timestamp when the tree inventory was last modified. - `checksum` (string): A unique checksum for the tree inventory resource.  ## Error Responses  - `404 Not Found`: The specified domain does not exist or the user does not have access to it. - `422 Unprocessable Entity`: The request body is invalid or missing required fields. - `429 Too Many Requests`: An error occurred while submitting the job due to resource exhaustion.

Maximum 1000 treatments allowed.  - `featureMasks` (array of strings, optional): List of Features to mask tree inventory data.  ### TreeMap Source Configuration  If `\"TreeMap\"` is included in the `sources`, the request body can include additional configurations for `TreeMap`:  - `TreeMap` (object, optional): Advanced configurations for the TreeMap data source.   - `version` (string, optional): The version of TreeMap to use. Default is `\"2016\"`. Possible values are:     - `\"2014\"`: Use the 2014 version of TreeMap.     - `\"2016\"`: Use the 2016 version of TreeMap.   - `seed` (integer, optional): The random seed to use for generating the tree inventory. If not provided, a random seed will be generated.   - `canopyHeightMapConfiguration` (object, optional): Canopy height map configuration for TreeMap data source. If provided, the canopy height map will be used to segment and impute the coarse 30m TreeMap data with high-resolution canopy height data. Details of this approach will be provided in an upcoming publication. Please contact support.fastfuels@silvxlabs.com for more information.     - `source` (string, required): The source of the canopy height map data. Possible values are:         - `\"Meta2024\"`: Use the Meta2024 canopy height map data. More information about this data source can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003442572300439X  ### File Source Configuration Generate Signed URL for Tree Inventory Upload  If the source is `\"file\"`, this endpoint generates a signed URL that allows users to upload a CSV file representing the tree inventory data. The signed URL is valid for 1 hour and has a maximum upload size of 500 MB.  The full work flow consists of the following steps: 1. Call this endpoint to get a signed URL 2. Perform a put request to send your file to the signed url. Here is a python example:  ```[python] with open(\"your_file_goes_here.csv\", \"rb\") as file:     upload_response = requests.put(         signed_url_response[\"file\"][\"url\"],         data=file,         headers=signed_url_response[\"file\"][\"headers\"],     ) ``` **Note**: the signed_url_response has a field named \"file\" with the relevant info for the put request.  3. Your file will be validated and processed in the background 4. The status of your upload can be retrieved via and inventory get() request  #### Required Columns  The CSV file must include the following columns with their specified data types and constraints:  1. **TREE_ID** (Integer)    - Unique identifier for each tree    - Must be an integer    - Cannot contain duplicates  2. **SPCD** (Integer)    - FIA species code    - Must be an integer    - Represents standard FIA species classifications  3. **STATUSCD** (Integer)    - Tree status code    - Must be one of these values:      - 0: No status      - 1: Live      - 2: Dead      - 3: Missing  4. **DIA** (Float)    - Diameter at breast height (DBH)    - Unit: centimeters (cm)    - Range: 0 to 1200 cm    - Nullable: Yes    - Measured at 1.37 meters above ground  5. **HT** (Float)    - Tree height    - Unit: meters (m)    - Range: 0 to 116 meters    - Nullable: Yes    - Measured from ground to tree top  6. **CR** (Float)    - Crown ratio    - Unit: ratio (dimensionless)    - Range: 0 to 1    - Nullable: Yes    - Represents the ratio of crown length to total tree height  7. **X** (Float)    - X coordinate in projected coordinate system    - Unit: meters (m)    - Range: Must fall within domain bounds (west to east)    - Required: Yes    - Nullable: Yes    - Used for spatial positioning  8. **Y** (Float)    - Y coordinate in projected coordinate system    - Unit: meters (m)    - Range: Must fall within domain bounds (south to north)    - Required: Yes    - Nullable: Yes    - Used for spatial positioning  ### Treatments  The `treatments` field is an array of treatment objects. Each treatment object represents a silvicultural treatment to be applied to the tree inventory. Currently, there are two types of treatment types available:  1. Proportional Thinning 2. Directional Thinning  #### Proportional Thinning  - `method`: \"proportionalThinning\" (string, required) - `targetMetric`: \"basalArea\" (string, required) - `targetValue`: float (required)   - Unit: square meters per hectare (m²/ha)   - Represents the target basal area after thinning  #### Directional Thinning  - `method`: \"directionalThinning\" (string, required) - `direction`: (string, required)   - Possible values: \"below\" or \"above\"   - Indicates whether to thin from below (smallest to largest) or above (largest to smallest) - `targetMetric`: (string, required)   - Possible values: \"diameter\" or \"basalArea\" - `targetValue`: float (required)   - Units of the targetValue quantity depends on the targetMetric:     - For \"diameter\": centimeters (cm)     - For \"basalArea\": square meters per hectare (m²/ha)   - Represents the threshold for thinning (diameter) or the target basal area after thinning  Note: The order of treatments in the array determines the sequence in which they will be applied to the tree inventory.  ## Response  If the request is successful, the endpoint will return a `201 Created` status code and the created tree inventory resource in the response body. The response body will be a JSON object with the following fields:  - `status` (string): The status of the tree inventory. Will be set to `\"pending\"` initially. - `createdOn` (string): The timestamp when the tree inventory was created. - `modifiedOn` (string): The timestamp when the tree inventory was last modified. - `checksum` (string): A unique checksum for the tree inventory resource.  ## Error Responses  - `404 Not Found`: The specified domain does not exist or the user does not have access to it. - `422 Unprocessable Entity`: The request body is invalid or missing required fields. - `429 Too Many Requests`: An error occurred while submitting the job due to resource exhaustion.

        # Create Tree Inventory Export  ## Endpoint  ``` POST /v1/domains/{domainId}/inventories/tree/exports/{exportFormat} ```  ## Description  This endpoint initiates the creation of an export file for the tree inventory data of a specific domain. The data can be exported in various formats including CSV, Parquet, and GeoJSON. The export process runs in the background.  ## Path Parameters  - `domainId` (string, required): The unique identifier of the domain for which you want to create the tree inventory export. - `exportFormat` (string, required): The format in which to export the tree inventory data. Possible values are:   - `\"csv\"`: Export the data in CSV format.   - `\"parquet\"`: Export the data in Parquet format.   - `\"geojson\"`: Export the data in GeoJSON format.  ## Response  If the request is successful, the endpoint will return a `201 Created` status code and the export request details in the response body. The response body will be a JSON object with the following fields:  - `status` (string): The status of the export request. Will be set to `\"pending\"` initially. - `createdOn` (string): The timestamp when the export request was created. - `modifiedOn` (string): The timestamp when the export request was last modified. - `expiresOn` (string): The timestamp when the export request will expire (7 days from creation). - `signedUrl` (string, optional): The signed URL to download the exported file. This field will be `null` initially.  ## Error Responses  - `404 Not Found`: The specified domain does not exist or the user does not have access to it. - `422 Unprocessable Entity`: The export format is invalid or the request cannot be processed.  ## Usage Notes  - Ensure that the tree inventory for the specified domain is completed before initiating an export. - The export request will be processed in the background. Use the GET endpoint to check the status.

Users can check the status, metadata, and download URL of the export request.  ## Path Parameters  - `domainId` (string, required): The unique identifier of the domain for which you want to retrieve the tree inventory export. - `exportFormat` (string, required): The format of the export request. Possible values are:   - `\"csv\"`: Retrieve the CSV export request details.   - `\"parquet\"`: Retrieve the Parquet export request details.   - `\"geojson\"`: Retrieve the GeoJSON export request details.  ## Response  If the request is successful, the endpoint will return a `200 OK` status code and the export request details in the response body. The response body will be a JSON object with the following fields:  - `status` (string): The status of the export request. Possible values are `\"pending\"`, `\"running\"`, `\"completed\"`, `\"failed\"`, and `\"expired\"`. - `createdOn` (string): The timestamp when the export request was created. - `modifiedOn` (string): The timestamp when the export request was last modified. - `expiresOn` (string): The timestamp when the export request will expire. - `signedUrl` (string, optional): The signed URL to download the exported file. This will be `null` if the status is not `\"completed\"`.  ## Error Responses  - `404 Not Found`: The specified domain does not exist or the user does not have access to it. - `404 Not Found`: The specified export request does not exist.  ## Usage Notes  - Once the export is completed, the `status` will change to `\"completed\"`, and the `signedUrl` field will be populated with a URL to download the export file. - The signed URL will be valid for 7 days from the creation of the export request, as indicated by the `expiresOn` field. - To download the exported file, make a GET request to the provided `signedUrl` once it's available. - If the current time is past the `expiresOn` timestamp, the `status` will change to `\"expired\"`, and the `signedUrl` will be set to `null`. - There is no separate download endpoint. Use the `signedUrl` provided in the export details to download the file directly.  ## Example Workflow  1. Create an export request using the POST endpoint. 2. Periodically check the status of the export using the GET endpoint. 3. Once the status is `\"completed\"`, retrieve the `signedUrl` from the export details. 4. Use the `signedUrl` to download the exported file within 7 days of the export creation.

        # Get Tree Inventory Export  ## Endpoint  ``` GET /v1/domains/{domainId}/inventories/tree/exports/{exportFormat} ```  ## Description  This endpoint retrieves the details of a tree inventory export request for a specific domain. Users can check the status, metadata, and download URL of the export request.  ## Path Parameters  - `domainId` (string, required): The unique identifier of the domain for which you want to retrieve the tree inventory export. - `exportFormat` (string, required): The format of the export request. Possible values are:   - `\"csv\"`: Retrieve the CSV export request details.   - `\"parquet\"`: Retrieve the Parquet export request details.   - `\"geojson\"`: Retrieve the GeoJSON export request details.  ## Response  If the request is successful, the endpoint will return a `200 OK` status code and the export request details in the response body. The response body will be a JSON object with the following fields:  - `status` (string): The status of the export request. Possible values are `\"pending\"`, `\"running\"`, `\"completed\"`, `\"failed\"`, and `\"expired\"`. - `createdOn` (string): The timestamp when the export request was created. - `modifiedOn` (string): The timestamp when the export request was last modified. - `expiresOn` (string): The timestamp when the export request will expire. - `signedUrl` (string, optional): The signed URL to download the exported file. This will be `null` if the status is not `\"completed\"`.  ## Error Responses  - `404 Not Found`: The specified domain does not exist or the user does not have access to it. - `404 Not Found`: The specified export request does not exist.  ## Usage Notes  - Once the export is completed, the `status` will change to `\"completed\"`, and the `signedUrl` field will be populated with a URL to download the export file. - The signed URL will be valid for 7 days from the creation of the export request, as indicated by the `expiresOn` field. - To download the exported file, make a GET request to the provided `signedUrl` once it's available. - If the current time is past the `expiresOn` timestamp, the `status` will change to `\"expired\"`, and the `signedUrl` will be set to `null`. - There is no separate download endpoint. Use the `signedUrl` provided in the export details to download the file directly.  ## Example Workflow  1. Create an export request using the POST endpoint. 2. Periodically check the status of the export using the GET endpoint. 3. Once the status is `\"completed\"`, retrieve the `signedUrl` from the export details. 4. Use the `signedUrl` to download the exported file within 7 days of the export creation.
