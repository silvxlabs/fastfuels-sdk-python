        # Create Surface Grid  This endpoint creates a new surface grid resource for a specific domain. Surface grid data represents various surface attributes (e.g., fuel load, fuel height, fuel moisture) that exist within the spatial context of a domain. The surface grid data can be generated using a variety of data sources (e.g., LANDFIRE, uniform values) and interpolation methods.  On resource creation, the surface grid data is set to a status of \"pending\". The surface grid data is generated in the background using the specified method and data sources. Once the surface grid data is generated and available for user access, the status is updated to \"completed\".  ## Endpoint  ``` POST /v1/domains/{domainId}/grids/surface ```  ## Path Parameters  - `domainId` (string, required): The unique identifier of the domain for   which you want to create the surface grid.  ## Request Body  The request body should be a JSON object containing the following fields:  - `attributes` (array of strings, required): List of attributes to include in the surface grid. Possible values are:   - `\"fuelLoad\"`   - `\"fuelDepth\"`   - `\"fuelMoisture\"`   - `\"SAVR\"`   - `\"FBFM\"`  ### Attribute Descriptions, Units, and Sources  - `fuelLoad` (kg/m²): The mass of the fuel per unit area. - `fuelDepth` (m): The depth of the surface fuel bed above the ground. - `fuelMoisture` (unitless): The moisture content of the fuel. - `SAVR` (1/m): Surface Area to Volume Ratio - `FBFM` (unitless): Fire Behavior Fuel Model  Each attribute can be sourced from different data sources. By default, the system will use pre-defined data sources to acquire data for the specified attributes. However, if you want to specify additional information for how to acquire an attribute, you can provide detailed instructions in the request body. This is analogous to ordering a burger at a restaurant:  - If you just order a burger (specify the attribute), you'll get a default burger. - If you want pickles, a specific type of cheese, or the meat cooked medium rare, you need to specify those details (provide additional information for the attribute).  To specify additional information for an attribute, add a field with the attribute name to the request body. For example:  ```json {     \"attributes\": [\"fuelLoad\", \"fuelDepth\", \"fuelMoisture\"],     \"fuelLoad\": {         \"source\": \"LANDFIRE\",         \"product\": \"FBFM40\",         \"version\": \"2022\",         \"interpolationMethod\": \"nearest\"     },     \"fuelMoisture\": {\"source\": \"uniform\", \"value\": 0.2} } ```  This example specifies the specific source, product, version, and interpolation method to use for the `fuelLoad` attribute. For the `fuelMoisture` attribute, it specifies a uniform value of 0.2.  The general form of this construction is as follows:  - `fuelLoad`, `fuelDepth`, `fuelMoisture`, `SAVR`, `FBFM` (object, optional): The data source for the respective attribute. The structure of these objects depends on the source specified.  #### Uniform Source  If the source is `\"uniform\"`, the object should have the following fields:  - `value` (float, required): The uniform value for the attribute.  #### LANDFIRE Source  If the source is `\"LANDFIRE\"`, the object should have the following fields:  - `product` (string, required): The LANDFIRE product to use. Possible values are:   - `\"FBFM40\"`   - `\"FBFM13\"` - `version` (string, required): The version of the LANDFIRE product. Possible values are:   - `\"2022\"` - `interpolationMethod` (string, required): The interpolation method to use. Possible values are:   - `\"nearest\"`   - `\"linear\"`   - `\"cubic\"`   - `\"zipper\"`  ##### Fire Behavior Fuel Models (FBFM)    - `\"FBFM40\"`: Fire Behavior Fuel Model 40 corresponding to the Scott and Burgan (SB40) fuel model set.   - `\"FBFM13\"`: Fire Behavior Fuel Model 13 corresponding to the original Anderson (A13) fuel model set.  ## Response  If the request is successful, the endpoint will return a `201 Created` status code and the created surface grid resource in the response body. The response body will be a JSON object with the following fields:  - `status` (string): The status of the surface grid. Will be set to `\"pending\"` initially. - `createdOn` (string): The timestamp when the surface grid was created. - `modifiedOn` (string): The timestamp when the surface grid was last modified. - `checksum` (string): A unique checksum for the surface grid resource. - `attributes` (array of strings): The list of attributes included in the surface grid. - `fuelLoad`, `fuelDepth`, `fuelMoisture`, `SAVR`, `FBFM` (object): The data source information for the respective attribute.  ## Error Responses  - `404 Not Found`: The specified domain does not exist or the user does not have access to it. - `422 Unprocessable Entity`: The request body is invalid, the data sources are not compatible with the domain CRS, or required fields are missing.

This action removes the surface grid data from the database and cancels any ongoing job execution related to the surface grid.  ## Endpoint  ``` DELETE /v1/domains/{domainId}/grids/surface ```  ## Path Parameters  - `domainId` (string, required): The unique identifier of the domain for which you want to delete the surface grid.  ## Response  If the request is successful, the endpoint will return a `204 No Content` status code. This indicates that the surface grid has been successfully deleted and no content is returned in the response body.  ## Error Responses  - `404 Not Found`: The specified domain does not exist or the user does not have access to it. - `404 Not Found`: The surface grid for the specified domain does not exist.  ## Usage Notes  - Deleting a surface grid is a permanent action and cannot be undone. Ensure that you have the correct domain ID before making the delete request. - The endpoint will also cancel any ongoing job execution related to the surface grid and remove the associated data from the cache and cloud storage.

Currently, supported formats are `\"zarr\"` and `\"geotiff\"`.  ## Response  If successful, returns a `200 OK` status code and a JSON object with:  - `status` (string): Current status of the export (`\"pending\"`, `\"processing\"`, `\"completed\"`, `\"failed\"`, or `\"expired\"`). - `createdOn` (string): Timestamp of export request creation. - `modifiedOn` (string): Timestamp of last modification. - `expiresOn` (string): Expiration timestamp. - `signedUrl` (string, optional): URL to download the exported file, if status is `\"completed\"`.  ## Error Responses  - `404 Not Found`: Domain or export request not found.  ## Usage Notes  - Use this endpoint to check the status of an export request. - When status is `\"completed\"`, use the `signedUrl` to download the file. - The signed URL expires 7 days after creation.
