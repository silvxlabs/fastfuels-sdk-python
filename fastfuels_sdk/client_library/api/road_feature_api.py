        # Create Road Feature  This endpoint creates a new road feature resource for a specific domain. Road features represent various road attributes (e.g., type, condition) within the spatial context of a domain. The road feature data can be generated using various data sources (e.g., OSM) and methods.  On resource creation, the road feature data is set to a status of \"pending\". The road feature data is generated in the background using the specified methods and data sources. Once the road feature data is generated and available for user access, the status is updated to \"completed\".  ## Endpoint  ``` POST /v1/domains/{domainId}/features/road ```  ## Path Parameters  - `domainId` (string, required): The unique identifier of the domain for which you want to create the road feature.  ## Request Body  The request body should be a JSON object containing the following fields:  - `sources` (array of strings, required): List of sources to include in the road feature. Currently, possible values include: - `\"OSM\"`: OpenStreetMap data source.  ## Response  If the request is successful, the endpoint will return a `201 Created` status code and the created road feature resource in the response body. The response body will be a JSON object with the following fields:  - `status` (string): The status of the road feature. Will be set to `\"pending\"` initially. - `createdOn` (string): The timestamp when the road feature was created. - `modifiedOn` (string): The timestamp when the road feature was last modified. - `checksum` (string): A unique checksum for the road feature resource. - `sources` (array of strings): The list of sources used for the road feature.  ## Error Responses  - `404 Not Found`: The specified domain does not exist or the user does not have access to it. - `422 Unprocessable Entity`: The road feature is not supported for local coordinate systems, or required fields are missing. - `429 Too Many Requests`: An error occurred while running the job due to resource exhaustion.  ## Usage Notes  - If the domain is in a \"local\" coordinate system, the endpoint will raise a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error. - The endpoint will run the specified job to generate the road feature data if \"OSM\" is included in the sources. - The endpoint updates the road feature data in the database and logs relevant information for monitoring and debugging.

        # Create Road Feature Export  ## Endpoint  ``` POST /v1/domains/{domainId}/features/road/exports/{exportFormat} ```  ## Description  This endpoint initiates the creation of an export file for the road feature data of a specific domain, in the specified format.  ## Path Parameters  - `domainId` (string, required): The unique identifier of the domain. - `exportFormat` (string, required): The format in which to export the road feature data. Possible value:   - `\"geojson\"`: Export the feature data in GeoJSON format.  ## Response  If successful, returns a `201 Created` status code and a JSON object with:  - `status` (string): Initially set to `\"pending\"`. - `createdOn` (string): Timestamp of the export request creation. - `modifiedOn` (string): Timestamp of the last modification. - `expiresOn` (string): Expiration timestamp (7 days from creation). - `signedUrl` (string, optional): Initially `null`, populated when export is completed.  ## Error Responses  - `404 Not Found`: If the domain is not found, or there are no water or road features created. - `429 Too Many Requests`: Error submitting the export job due to resource exhaustion.  ## Usage Notes  - The export will be processed as a background job, and the status will initially be set to `\"pending\"`. - Check the export status using a separate endpoint to monitor progress. - Once the export is complete, use the `signedUrl` to download the GeoJSON file.

Possible value:     - `\"geojson\"`: Export the feature data in GeoJSON format.  ## Response  If successful, returns a `200 OK` status code and a JSON object with:  - `status` (string): Current status of the export (`\"pending\"`, `\"running\"`, `\"completed\"`, `\"failed\"`, or `\"expired\"`). - `createdOn` (string): Timestamp of export request creation. - `modifiedOn` (string): Timestamp of the last modification. - `expiresOn` (string): Expiration timestamp. - `signedUrl` (string, optional): URL to download the exported file, if status is `\"completed\"`.  ## Error Responses  - `404 Not Found`: Export not found or no feature data exists for the specified export format.  ## Usage Notes  - Use this endpoint to check the status of a road feature export request. - Once the status is `\"completed\"`, you can use the `signedUrl` to download the exported GeoJSON file. - The signed URL expires 7 days after creation.
