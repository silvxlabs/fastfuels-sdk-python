Domain Endpoint\n\nThis endpoint creates a new domain resource based on a spatial extent and additional details provided by the user. The domain resource acts as the spatial container for all other resources that create data within the system.\n\n## What is a Domain Resource?\n\nA domain resource is a spatial container that represents a specific geographical area. It includes metadata such as the name, description, creation date, and the spatial extent defined by geographic coordinates. Domains are used to organize and manage spatial data and operations within a defined area. The data can be vectorized, such as holding features or trees in an inventory, or rasterized, such as a 3D canopy fuel grid or a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).\n\n## Endpoint: `POST /domains`\n\n### Request Body\n\nThe request body should be a GeoJSON object defined by the [GeoJSON specification (RFC 7946)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946). It can be either a Feature or a FeatureCollection. The required fields differ slightly between these two types, but there are some shared fields as well.\n\n#### Shared Fields\n\nThese fields are required for both Feature and FeatureCollection inputs:\n\n- **type**: (string) Must be either \"Feature\" or \"FeatureCollection\".\n- **name**: (string, optional) The name of the domain.\n- **description**: (string, optional) A brief description of the domain.\n- **horizontalResolution**: (float) The horizontal resolution in meters of a regular grid representation of the domain.\n- **verticalResolution**: (float) The vertical resolution in meters of a regular grid representation of the domain.\n- **crs**: (GeoJsonCRS) The GeoJSON specification formatted coordinate reference system (CRS) of the domain.\n  - **type**: (string) Must be \"name\".\n  - **properties**: (object) The properties object containing the CRS details.\n    - **name**: (string) The name of the CRS, e.g., \"EPSG:4326\". Must be either 'local' or a valid authority string.\n\n#### Feature-specific Fields\n\nWhen the input type is \"Feature\", the following additional field is required:\n\n- **geometry**: (GeoJSON Geometry object) A GeoJSON geometry object defining the spatial location of the domain.\n  - **type**: (string) Must be a valid GeoJSON type, e.g., \"Polygon\".\n  - **coordinates**: (array) An array of coordinates defining the geometry.\n\n#### FeatureCollection-specific Fields\n\nWhen the input type is \"FeatureCollection\", the following additional field is required:\n\n- **features**: (array of Feature objects) An array of Feature objects. Each Feature object should have:\n  - **type**: (string) Must be \"Feature\".\n  - **geometry**: (GeoJSON Geometry object) As described in the Feature-specific fields.\n\n### Response\n\nOn successful creation, the endpoint returns the newly created domain resource with the following fields:\n\n- **id**: (string) A unique identifier for the domain.\n- **name**: (string) The name of the domain.\n- **description**: (string) A brief description of the domain.\n- **createdOn**: (datetime) The date and time the domain was created.\n- **modifiedOn**: (datetime) The date and time the domain was last modified.\n- **type**: (string) Will be \"FeatureCollection\".\n- **features**: (array) An array of two Feature objects:\n  1. The domain feature (padded bounding box):\n     - **type**: (string) Will be \"Feature\".\n     - **geometry**: (GeoJSON) The GeoJSON geometry representing the padded spatial extent of the domain.\n     - **properties**: (object) Additional properties of the domain feature.\n       - **name**: (string) Will be \"domain\".\n       - **area**: (float) The area of the domain in square meters.\n       - **perimeter**: (float) The perimeter of the domain in meters.\n  2. The input feature:\n     - **type**: (string) Will be \"Feature\".\n     - **geometry**: (GeoJSON) The GeoJSON geometry representing the original input geometry.\n     - **properties**: (object) Additional properties of the input feature.\n       - **name**: (string) Will be \"input\".\n       - **area**: (float) The area of the input geometry in square meters.\n       - **perimeter**: (float) The perimeter of the input geometry in meters.\n- **horizontalResolution**: (float) The horizontal resolution of the domain.\n- **verticalResolution**: (float) The vertical resolution of the domain.\n- **crs**: (GeoJsonCRS) The coordinate reference system of the domain.\n- **utmAuthorityString**: (string, optional) The UTM authority string if the input was projected to UTM.\n\n### Processing from Request to Response\n\nThe system performs several processing steps to convert the Request Body into the Response Body:\n\n1. **CRS Handling and Projection**:\n   - If the input CRS is geographic (e.g., EPSG:4326), the geometry is automatically projected to the appropriate UTM zone.\n   - If the input CRS is already projected, the domain will keep that CRS.\n   - If the input CRS is 'local', the spatial data is assumed to be NOT geo-referenced, and no projection is performed.\n\n2. **Bounding Box Calculation**:\n   - The system calculates the bounding box of the input geometry (or the combined geometries for a FeatureCollection).\n\n3. **Resolution-based Padding**:\n   - The bounding box is padded out to the nearest multiple of the user-provided horizontal resolution.\n\n4. **FeatureCollection Creation**:\n   - The system creates a FeatureCollection with two features: the padded bounding box (domain) and the original input geometry.\n\nThese steps ensure that the domain's extent is regularized, aligned with the specified resolution, and in a suitable projected coordinate system (when applicable), which allows for subsequent grid-based operations.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n1. **Projection**: The domain will always be stored in a projected coordinate system if the input is geographic. This ensures consistency and accuracy for spatial operations within the domain.\n\n2. **UTM Zone Selection**: When projecting from a geographic CRS, the system automatically selects the appropriate UTM zone based on the centroid of the input geometry.\n\n3. **FeatureCollection Handling**: When a FeatureCollection is provided as input, the domain will be created based on the combined extent of all features in the collection.\n\n4. **Zero Area Handling**: If the spatial extent has zero area (e.g., a point or line), the endpoint will raise an error.\n\n5. **Resolution Alignment**: The spatial extent is padded out to the nearest multiple of horizontal and vertical resolution (in meters) to ensure grid alignment.\n\n6. **Maximum Area**: Currently, the maximum area for a domain is 16 square kilometers. We are planning to increase this limit in the future. If this limitation is an issue for your use case, please contact us for assistance.\n\n7. **CRS Preservation**: If you provide data in a specific projected CRS, that CRS will be preserved in the domain. This is useful for maintaining consistency with existing data sources or specific regional requirements.\n\n### Error Responses\n\n- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: The spatial extent is invalid.\n  - **Detail**: \"Invalid spatial extent. The area of the spatial extent must be greater than zero meters.\"\n  - **Detail**: \"Invalid spatial extent. The area of the spatial extent must be less than sixteen square kilometers.\"\n- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred while creating the domain resource.","operationId":"create_domain","security":[{"APIKeyHeader":[]},{"HTTPBearer":[]}],"requestBody":{"required":true,"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/CreateDomainRequest"},"examples":{"feature collection WGS84":{"value":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{},"geometry":{"coordinates":[[[-114.09545796676623,46.8324794598619],[-114.11217537297199,46.8324794598619],[-114.11217537297199,46.82496749915157],[-114.09545796676623,46.82496749915157],[-114.09545796676623,46.8324794598619]]],"type":"Polygon"}}],"name":"Example","description":"This is an example domain.","horizontalResolution":2,"verticalResolution":1},"summary":"Example WGS84 FeatureCollection","description":"This example creates a domain from a FeatureCollection GeoJSON object.

Currently, only one data source at a time is supported. Possible values are:\n  - `\"TreeMap\"`: Indicates that the tree inventory should be created using the TreeMap raster product. This approach generates a tree inventory with national coverage.\n\n- `modifications` (array of objects, optional): List of modifications to apply to the tree inventory data. Maximum 1000 modifications allowed.\n\n- `treatments` (array of objects, optional): List of silvicultural treatments to apply to the tree inventory. Maximum 1000 treatments allowed.\n\n- `featureMasks` (array of strings, optional): List of Features to mask tree inventory data.\n\n### TreeMap Source Configuration\n\nIf `\"TreeMap\"` is included in the `sources`, the request body can include additional configurations for `TreeMap`:\n\n- `TreeMap` (object, optional): Advanced configurations for the TreeMap data source.\n  - `version` (string, optional): The version of TreeMap to use. Default is `\"2016\"`. Possible values are:\n    - `\"2014\"`: Use the 2014 version of TreeMap.\n    - `\"2016\"`: Use the 2016 version of TreeMap.\n  - `seed` (integer, optional): The random seed to use for generating the tree inventory. If not provided, a random seed will be generated.\n  - `canopyHeightMapConfiguration` (object, optional): Canopy height map configuration for TreeMap data source.

Attributes represent the an additional dimension in the 3D gridded data. Possible values are:\n  - `\"bulkDensity\"`\n  - `\"fuelMoisture\"`\n  - `\"SPCD\"`\n\n### Attribute Descriptions and Sources\n\n- `bulkDensity` (kg/m³): The mass of the tree fuel per unit volume of the occupied cell.\n- `foliarMoisture` (%): Live foliar moisture content of the occupied cell.\n- `SPCD` (unitless): The FIA species code of the occupied cell.\n\nEach attribute can be sourced from different data sources. By default, the system will use pre-defined data sources to acquire data for the specified attributes. However, if you want to specify additional information for how to acquire an attribute, you can provide detailed instructions in the request body.\n\nTo specify additional information for an attribute, add a field with the attribute name to the request body. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"attributes\": [\"bulkDensity\", \"fuelMoisture\"],\n    \"bulkDensity\": {\n        \"source\": \"TreeInventory\",\n        \"biomassModel\": \"NSVB\"\n    },\n    \"fuelMoisture\": {\"source\": \"uniform\", \"value\": 175}\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `bulkDensity` attribute is sourced from the Tree Inventory using the NSVB biomass model, and the `fuelMoisture` attribute is set to a uniform value of 175%.\n\nThe general form of this construction is as follows:\n\n- `bulkDensity`, `fuelMoisture`, `SPCD` (object, optional): The data source for the respective attribute. The structure of these objects depends on the source specified.\n\n#### Uniform Source\n\nIf the source is `\"uniform\"`, the object should have the following fields:\n\n- `value` (float, required): The uniform value for the attribute.\n\n#### Tree Inventory Source\n\nIf the source is `\"TreeInventory\"`, and the attribute `\"bulkDensity\"`, then we need to estimate a biomass. The biomass allometry model used is specified with the following field:\n\n- `biomassModel` (string, required for bulkDensity): The biomass model to use. Possible values are:\n  - `\"Jenkins\"`\n  - `\"NSVB\"` (default)\n\nNote: The `biomassModel` field only applies to the `bulkDensity` attribute and is not used for other attributes such as `SPCD`.\n\n## Response\n\nIf the request is successful, the endpoint will return a `201 Created` status code and the created tree grid resource in the response body.
