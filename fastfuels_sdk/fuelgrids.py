    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset_id : str
        The ID of the dataset to use.
    treelist_id : str
        The ID of the treelist to use.
    name : str
        The name of the fuelgrid.
    description : str
        The description of the fuelgrid.
    distribution_method : str
        The method to use for distributing fuel data. "uniform", "random", and
        "realistic" are currently supported.
    horizontal_resolution : float
        The horizontal resolution of the fuelgrid in meters.
    vertical_resolution : float
        The vertical resolution of the fuelgrid in meters.
    border_pad : float
        The amount of padding to add to the border of the fuelgrid in meters.
        Voxelized trees that intersect with the border of the domain can be
        cut off if the entire canopy is not included in the domain. This extra
        padding can ensure that the entire canopy is included in the domain.
    surface_fuel_source : str
        The source of the surface fuel data. Only "LF_SB40" is currently
        supported. Defaults to "LF_SB40".
    surface_interpolation_method : str
        The interpolation method to use for surface fuel data. "nearest",
        "zipper", "linear", and "cubic" are supported. Defaults to "nearest".
    write_sparse_array : bool
        If True, a sparse fuel grid array will be written to disk. This is in
        addition to the zarr file. Defaults to False. This is useful for
        linking the fuelgrid to treelist data for fire effects modeling. The
        sparse array is a 3D array with the same dimensions as the zarr file.
        Writing the sparse array can take a long time and is not recommended
        for large fuel grids.

    Returns
    -------
    Fuelgrid
        Voxelized treelist.

    Raises
    ------
    HTTPError
        If the API returns an unsuccessful status code.
    ValueError
        If surface_fuel_source is not "LF_SB40".
    ValueError
        If surface_interpolation_method is not "nearest", "zipper", "linear",
        or "cubic".
    ValueError
        If distribution_method is not "uniform", "random", or "realistic".

    Notes
    -----
    There is a slight discrepancy between the spatial extent of the fuelgrid and
    the spatial extent of the Dataset. The fuelgrid spatial extent rounded out
    to the nearest multiple of the horizontal resolution. This ensures that all
    grid cells are a uniform size specified by the horizontal resolution.

    Individual trees may extend beyond the Fuelgrid spatial extent. If this is
    the case the canopy of the tree will be cut off at the edge of the
    Fuelgrid. This can be avoided by increasing the border_pad.
