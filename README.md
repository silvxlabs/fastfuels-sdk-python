# Python SDK for the FastFuels API

## What is FastFuels?

FastFuels is an innovative solution that propels the use of advanced 3D fire 
models into the future of fire and fuels management. It acts as a "3D fuels 
superhighway," seamlessly merging existing data sources with cutting-edge 
modeling to produce the detailed 3D fuel data required by these models. With 
its unique ability to generate and manage comprehensive fuels data for large 
areas, FastFuels enhances the precision and context of fire behavior insights 
and management strategies. Moreover, it encourages the incorporation of new 
data sources and techniques in the field, ensuring its relevance and 
adaptability in the dynamic landscape of remote sensing and wildland fuels 
science. Stay tuned as we continue to develop and refine FastFuels, paving the 
way for next-generation fire models.
